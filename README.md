4. Abstract 
Conservation projects are now not only assessed by   their   ecological   effectiveness,   but   also   by how well they gain local support and avoid negative effects on human well-being (Milner-   Gulland et al.,   2014;   Bennett et al.,   2019). While   evaluations   of social   impact   assessment   have   been   undertaken   (de   Lange et al.,   2015),   recently,   little   attention   has   been   spent   on   refining   techniques   and   practicing   improvements   suggested   in   the   past   (Margoluis et al.,   2009).   In response to this lack of engagement, the research will   compile   suggestions   made   by   assessments,   refine   them,   and   test   them when   undertaking   its   own   assessment   of the   social   impacts of oyster   habitat   restoration.   Located   in   Essex, the   research   will assess   the   ENORI   project and   its goal of protecting cultural value   (ENORI, 2023). 
6. Aims and objectives of project 
The   research   aims   to   cultivate   an   effective   approach   to   the   assessment   of social   impacts   made   by   conservation   projects   based   on   the   findings   of   past   evaluations   (Jones et al.,   2017).   Doing   so would   offer   project   stakeholders   an   example   of   how   they   could   approach   their   social impact assessments so that they collect representative data   which helps improve   their public   relations and their project as a   result   (Bennett, 2016;   Bennett et al.,   2019).   This   cultivated   approach   will   be   tested,   and   subsequently   evaluated,   during   its   assessment   of   the      ‘ENORI’    oyster       habitat      restoration      project,    a       branch      of    conservation      which       has historically    been    assessed    mainly    by    its    economic    and    ecological    impacts      (Coen    and   Luckenbach, 2000;   McAfee et al., 2020).The   conceptual   side   of   this   research   will   compile   and   draw   from   journals,   articles,   and   reports.   The   empirical   side   of the   research will   interview   ENORI   project   stakeholders   and   team   members,   alongside   locals   in   Essex   coastal   communities.   These   interviews   will   be   undertaken   in   collaboration   with   the   ENORI   project   itself   and   the   Tollesbury      Mersea   Native    Oyster    Fishery    Co      Ltd,      a      partner    of    the      project.      The      research      will      contribute   empirically to the ‘ENORI’   project’s   heritage-based goal,   and   conceptually   to   conservation   projects of all types through the   improvement of their   own social impact   assessments.
The   research objectives are:
1) To evaluate the approaches to social impact assessment suggested by previous research
2) To create a refined approach   based   on   this   previous   research
3)To      test      this      new      approach      trough      the      assessment      of    the       ENORI      oyster      habitat   management project’s social impacts via   interviews
4) To contribute to the ‘ENORI’ project though   the   sharing   of   collected   data
5) To   impact the approach to social impact   assessments   by conservation   projects
7. Proposed research In   the    modern   world,   conservation    projects   can    be    scrutinised    based    not   just   on   their   ecological results, but also their social impacts. This   has sparked   an   interest within   projects   to   assess   the   social   impacts   they   are   having   on   local   communities   and   public   observers   (Kaplan-Hallam   and   Bennett,   2017),   and   to   also   focus   on   and   marketing   positive   social   effects   as   an   actual   part   of   their   project’s   aims   (Browder,   2002).   Projects   assessing   their   social impact is important to them maintaining positive public relations   (Bennett   et   al., 2019)   and their project’s development, but a common   problem   is that   projects   struggle to   develop   effective   methods   of   social   impact   assessment   (Stem et al.,   2005).    In   response,   many   evaluations    of    these    social      impact      assessments      have      been      undertaken      (Wilder      and   Walpole, 2008; de   Lange et   al.,   2015).However,a key issue is that very few investigations have been conducted in order look over   the suggestions made by these evaluations, and to use their suggestions to create new and   improved   approaches to   social   impact   assessment   (Margoluis   et   al.,   2009).   Its this   lack of   engagement    and    activity    that    this    research    will    address.    This    research’s    compiling    of   multiple   social   impact   assessment   evaluations   will   help   identify   effective   approaches   and   suggestions made by these evaluations. This knowledge will subsequently be used to refine   and   create a   new approach to   social   impact assessment.   Though   this   part   of the   research   would be conceptual, empirical evidence   for its effectiveness would then be collected though   its   use   in assessing the   ENORI   project.The   Essex   Native   Oyster   Restoration   Initiative   (ENORI)   is   an   oyster   habitat   restoration   project.    Its    goal    is   to    reintroduce      and   conserve   self-sustaining    European    native    oyster   (Ostrea edulis,       Linnaeus,    1758)    populations   within   the   Blackwater,   Crouch,   Roach   and   Colne   Estuaries of Essex,   UK (ENORI, 2023). O. edulis has   been   in decline   across   Europe   due to overharvesting, habitat degradation, and disease (Gaffney, 2006), but   EDNORI aims   to   promote sustainable fishing, and to also   protect   Essex’s oyster fishing   heritage   and   long   history   of   native-oyster   fishing   (ENORI, 2023).The   impact   of   this   social   goal   is   what   the   empirical   part   of   this   research   will   focus   on.   In   partnership    with    ENORI      and    the    Tollesbury        Mersea      Native      Oyster      Fishery      Co      Ltd   ,   interviews   based   around   this   goal with   ENORI   stakeholders   and   team   members,   and with   local   Essex   coastal   community   members,   will   provide   data   on   the   social   impacts   ENORI   has had oncostal Essex communities. The assessment approach created by the conceptual   side of this research would then   be tested through   its assessment   o代 写GEOG0093 Conservation and  Environmental Management YEAR 2022-23SQL

The   following   plan   denotes   how   the   research will   achieve   its   previously   stated   objectives;   number filled brackets will identify which   research objectives are   being   met:1.   The   researcher will   conduct   an   extensive   literature   review   of social   impact   assessment   evaluations.   Reviewed   literature will   be   primarily   made   up of   journals, articles, and   reports.   During   this   review,   assessment   approaches   suggested   or   promoted   by   evaluators   will   be   compiled. Once the literature review has   concluded, the complied approaches will be further   reviewed,   providing   inspiration   for   a   quality   assessment   redesign   supported   by   evidence.   During this time   of literature   review, the   researcher will   also   be   in   contact   with   ENORI,   the   Tollesbury    Mersea   Native Oyster   Fishery Co   Ltd, and   coastal   community   members. This   will   be   done   in   order   to   prepare   for   data   collection,   plan   transport   and   journeys,   and   to   arrange dates with   interviewees.   (1, 2)2.   The   researcher   will   choose   interviewees   based   on   their   knowledge   of   ENORI,   their   knowledge   of local   Essex   communities, or their   knowledge   of the   impacts   ENORI   has   had   on   the    local    communities.    It    will    be    expected    that    interviewees   will    not    have    in    depth   knowledge of every aspect, but by carefully choosing a mosaic of interviews, the researcher   will   gain   an   appropriate   picture   of   ENORI   and   Essex.   It   is   expected   that   new   interviewees   may make themselves known during data   collection.   (3)3. Once a   refined social   impact assessment   has   been created,   the   researcher will   travel   to   Essex and carry out   their interviews.   Questions   will   be   carefully   chosen   based   on   what   the   interviewee knows, and influenced by the assessment created by the conceptual part of   this   research . Standard questions asked to all interviewees will also be asked. Virtual interviews   will be carried out as well if needed.   Locations for the interview will   be   agreed;   this   could   be   at their home or   elsewhere.   (3)4.   Once   interviews   have   concluded, the   researcher will   undertake   data   analysis.   The   data   collected   will   also    be   shared   with    ENORI.    Results    from    the   analyses,   along   with    how   effective    it    was    to    use      during      data      collection,      will      determine      how      the      newly      created   assessment is evaluated.

5. A   report   of the   research   and   its findings will   be   shared   with   ENORI   stakeholders,   while   the   research’s findings will be   published as an academic report.   (4,5).
Timeline 
September 2023 – January 2024: Literature review,   communications with   collaborators
January    –   March 2024:   Interviews   in   Essex
March – July 2024:   Data Analysis
July – October 2024:   Ready   reports
8. In country collaborations and local benefits The   research will   be carried out   in collaboration with   ENORI,   and   the   Tollesbury      Mersea   Native Oyster Fishery Co Ltd. Data collected would benefit   ENORI, as the project   could   use   the data for   information on the social   impact   they’ve   had   on   local   communities.   Depending   on what the data looks like, the local communities could also benefit from ENORI amending   possible negative social   impacts from   its project, or bolstering   positive   ones.
9. How will the project further geographical knowledge? The research will provide the field of conservation with a modern example of a social impact   assessment approach. This   approach will   be a   refined   product of inspiration   gathered from   multiple social   impact assessment evaluations,   addressing the   current   inactivity within   this   branch   of   conservation   science.   The   data   collected   by   the   new   approach,   along   with   its   evaluation,   will    provide    conservation    practitioners   with    a    review    of   this    new    approach,   allowing   them   to   possibly   adopt   aspects   of   the   approach   for   their   own   projects.   It   also   provides data on the social impacts of   oyster habitat restoration projects, an impact of   oyster   habitat   restoration not usually   investigated.
The research and its results are intended to be published within The Social Science Journal.
10. Project outcomes and wider significance The   data   collected   by   the   research   can   be   used   by   ENORI   to   evaluate   its   project’s   social   impacts   on   local   Essex   communities.   As   a   result,   ENORI   would   be   able   to   address   and   negative   impacts they are   having on   local communities,   improving public   relations   between   themselves    and    local      Essex      communities      and      perhaps      removing       impacts    which      are   negatively affecting the community’s wellbeing. The   publication   of this   research   would   also   have    the    capacity    to      help      conservation      projects      of      all      types,      not    just      oyster      habitat   restoration.    This    is    because    the    review    of    a    newly      created      and      refined      social      impact   assessment approach could   provide conservation   projects with   inspiration and   evidence   to   improve their   won social impact assessments. Similar to Essex,   these changes in could also   benefit their project’s local   communities.For non-academic audiences, the research would provide an insightful investigation into the   social affects conservation projects can have on local communities, both good and bad. This   research   may   introduce   readers   to   how   conservation   projects   include   social   elements   as   well,   not   just   ecological   ones.   Readers   not   interested   in   oyster   reef   restoration   can   find   benefits from this research for conservation projects of any type   around   the world.
12. Summary of key elements of ethical assessment The   social   interaction   consistently   present   within   this   research   would   cause   most   ethical   issues. The key issue would be the interviews. To ensure   interviewees   are   comfortable and   do   not   feel   harassed,   the   ability   for   an   interviewee   to   not   answer   a   question,   stop   the   interview, and   leave the   interview   must   be allowed and   made   known to them.   Interviewees   must   also   not   be   forced   or   coerced   into   taking   part   in   an   interview. Any   children   who   are   interviewed   must   be   accompanied   by   an   adult   or   legal   guardian,   and   strict   permission   to   undertake   the   interview   must   be   received   by   said   adult   or   guardian.   Permission   must   be   given by each   interviewee for their answers to   be used   in   published   data.
All these ethical issues will be appropriately addressed   by   the   researcher.
